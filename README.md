# Floats Practice
This exercise is a basic introduction to using "float" as a layout technique in CSS. Floating is similar in concept to a text-wrap in MS Word or InDesign. 

In this exercise you will:
- Constrain images to their container
- Practice using float as a layout technique
- Change layout using a media query

## Tasks
- Start by looking at the images in the screenshots folder to familiarize yourself with where you are headed in this exercise. The screenshots are named based on the viewport width (in rems). The art direction of the images using the picture element has already been implemented for you. You will only need to address layout related issues in this assignment.
- Contrain the images to their container (do this as a "default" in the CSS)
- Each image/caption combo should take up 50% of the article width when the screen is 74rem or larger
  - The first image/caption combo should be aligned to the left and have text wrap around the right-hand side
  - The second image/caption combo should be aligned to the right and have text wrap around the left-hand side
- Make sure all of the image/caption combos are contrained within the article.
- Make live
